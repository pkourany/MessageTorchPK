MESSAGE/TWITTER TORCH
=====================

Adapted form repo here:  https://github.com/plan44/messagetorch

Code uses a jumper on pin D0 (to GND) to enable wifi/demo modes.  With pin D0 connected to GND, wifi is disabled and demo code will run.  With D0 left OPEN, wifi/cloud is enabled and demo does not run.
